# Smart Hearing Aid HEAR.I.B. (Hearing for Everyone: Augmented Real-time Interactive Beamforming)


## HackMIT 2019 Assistive Technology Track

This system tracks the eye movement of the user to pinpoint the target speaker, isolates and localizes the speaker's voice, and filters it to adjust the volume level. We envision this technology to be utilized by hearing-impaired individuals or individuals who are frequently in a situation where they need to hear a specific speaker in a loud environment.
